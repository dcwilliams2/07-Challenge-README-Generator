  ## Description
  This application is a file generator for a README file to use with the development of projects and applications.This application was developed to provide an efficient and effective means to building a README file for developers.I often felt that the process to create a quality README file was inefficient and could benefit from incorporating an automated system for developers. By doing so, developers are able to increase the amount of time available to their projects and applications.
